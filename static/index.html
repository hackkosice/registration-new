                    <h3 class="mt-4">Welcome to Hack Kosice Application Portal!</h3>
                    <p>We are really excited that you chose to participate in Hack Kosice 2022. If you are still unsure,
                        you can learn more about our hackathon on our <a href="https://hackkosice.com">main page</a>. We hope that the application process will
                        be as smooth as possible, and we will see you at the hackathon. However, the number of hackers we
                        can take is limited, so make sure you showcase your best qualities on the application to get chosen.</p>
                    <h4 class="mt-4">Important info about the application process</h4>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Set aside around 15-30 minutes to completely fill out the application.</li>
                        <li>There are multiple sections in the application. You can use them to save your progress and then return later.</li>
                        <li>You may want to join the hackathon as part of a team. First, fill out the application individually and afterwards you can
                        create and join teams in your dashboard.</li>
                        <li>We will be reviewing applications on a regular basis and we'll update you on the status of your application, as well as send you an email regarding our decision.</li>
                        <li>You can start the application process by clicking the <b>apply now</b> button and signing in with your MyMLH account, which you can use to access the 
                        registration portal.</li>
                    </ul>
