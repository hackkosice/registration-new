                        The mysterious error screen. Some didn't even belive it exists. But, as you can see, it does. What you are reading now
                        is our journal. We've traveled to great lenghts to find this error screen. We traveled all across the world and met all 
                        kinds of people. Some friendly, some less. There were many sleepless nights, tears, sweat and blood to accomplish this
                        task. But as we always do, we overcame it. As you probably know, the road here is pretty dangerous. But there is this...
                        aura that calls you back to this place. If you find yourself here often, send an owl with your problem to the address 
                        <a href = "mailto:dev@hackkosice.com">dev@hackkosice.com</a> with the subject "Application Portal". They will know what 
                        to do. If you're reading this, we are long gone, doing other cool things for the people of Hackathonia. And as a favor to 
                        all travelers following in our footsteps, our mage has set up a teleport to the nearest town, so you don't have to walk 
                        all the way back.<br><br>
                        Yours, <br>
